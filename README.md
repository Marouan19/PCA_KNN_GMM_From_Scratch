# Machine Learning Algorithms Implementation

This repository contains the implementation of three machine learning algorithms: Principal Component Analysis (PCA), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). Each algorithm is presented in a separate Jupyter notebook.

## Included Files:

- **Rapport.pdf**: This file contains the detailed report of the project, including theoretical explanations, implementation steps, and results.

- **PCA.ipynb**: This Jupyter notebook contains the implementation of Principal Component Analysis (PCA). It includes detailed explanations of the algorithm's steps, code demonstrations, and visualizations.

- **KNN_VF.ipynb**: This Jupyter notebook contains the implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. It includes detailed explanations of the algorithm's steps, code demonstrations, and visualizations.

- **GM_VF.ipynb**: This Jupyter notebook contains the implementation of the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). It includes detailed explanations of the algorithm's steps, code demonstrations, and visualizations.

## How to Run the Notebooks:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:


```bash
git clone https://github.com/Marouan19/PCA_KNN_GMM_From_Scratch
```

2. Ensure that you have Jupyter Notebook installed on your system.

3. Navigate to the cloned directory in your terminal and run the following command to start Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
4. Open one of the PCA.ipynb, KNN_VF.ipynb, or GM_VF.ipynb notebooks and execute the cells one by one to see the results.
